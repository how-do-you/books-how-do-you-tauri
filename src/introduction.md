# Introduction

If you have not yet read the `How do you Rust`, or are unfamiliar with Rust concepts, I recommend reading that book before this one, or taking a course on Rust. This book assumes a certain level of understanding of Rust concepts and won't explain them in too great detail. If you're familiar with programming concepts you may be able to follow along the book anyway, but don't use this book as your first dip into the Rust pool.

This is an unofficial book on how to use Tauri based on its state in version 1.0.0. Things may be different now from how they were when this book was written.
